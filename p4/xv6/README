Implementation Details:

First we implemented the clone and join syscalls. Then we modified other
syscalls and structs to account for threads, which are just threads with a special flag. A
lot of work was done in kernel/proc.c.

Next, we added threading. Threads rely on the clone and join syscalls. We also
had to create a table so that the could appropriately free memory.

Then, we implemented ticket locks using the code from OSTEP, as well as the
atomic FetchAndAdd inline assembly from Wikipedia.

Finally, we added condition variables. They manage pids via an array acting as a
circular queue. We had to place some code in the include/x86.h file in order to
get CV's functioning in user and kernel space. We did this in order to wake an
sleep the threads that use these variables.
