Implementation Details:

We started out by looking at the shell implementation in `xv6/user/sh.c` . This
provided a lot of insight in regard to how commands should be parsed, strutured,
and configured. We also took our own freedomes with the data structures.

It seems we parsed entries differently. We also stored everything differently.
Instead of having different structs for different commands, we have just one:
CommandList, a linked list of CommandNodes. Every CommandNode has an input and
output designation, as well as an associated list of arguments. Please see our
file `mysh.h` for more details on our data structures.
