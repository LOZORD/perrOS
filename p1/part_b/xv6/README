P1B - getprocs

For this project, I followed Perry's (my prof's) advice about using getpid as a
basis for which to model getprocs. I added a sys_getprocs function and included
it in the syscalls array. All sys_getprocs does is call a function called
proc_getprocs in kernel/proc.c, which does all of the computational work.

I wrote a simple test program (user/test_getprocs.c) that prints the
user-accessible getprocs function's return value.

To run this test program, just run `make qemu-nox`, then once inside the
emulator, run `test_getprocs`.
