Implementation Details:

P1A (Multable & Tnine)

These programs were pretty routine in implementation. Clearly the two most
advanced things I had to do were the pointer arithmetic in Multable and the
function pointer calls in Tnine.

However, I abstracted these into functions so that they were nice to work with.
For example, I wrote `at` in Multable and several printer functions in Tnine
(where different forms take a variety of arguments).

Other than that, the programming was fairly easy. As you can see in my code, I
have a lot of print statements for debugging. However, I can optionally leave
these out via the DEBUG preprocessor value found in each file.

In my Makefile, I incorporated the Python tests, as well as Valgrind tests for
each program. I used Valgrind to test for potential memory leaks.
